I am a second year PhD student at Brown University working with Daphna Buchsbaum at the Brown Dog Lab. 

My research focuses on how dogs think and learn about the world around them, particularly in their interactions with their human companions. I completed my Bachelor's in Biology and Psychology at the University of Toronto.
